Hey there! Welcome to Code with Us. On this site you'll find a collection of webinars, workshops, and code alongs on topics relating to front-end web development, including things like how get started using Git and GitHub, using the command line, shell scripting, or any number of other things. Most of our stuff is geared toward beginners right now, because we're all beginners ourselves. 

Judi, Julian, and Rodrick are all students or alumni of Udacity's Front End Web Development Nanodegree, through a generous scholarship from Google. We started Code with Us early on when we noticed that some of our fellow students could benefit from a different take on some of the material we were encountering in our curriculum. We also discovered that there's no better learning tool than having to teach! 

Since then, we've been fortunate to have some excellent guest lecturers and a wonderful group of participants in our webinars. We hope you'll subscribe and come along for the ride.
