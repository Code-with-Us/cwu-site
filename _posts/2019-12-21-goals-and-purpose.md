I'm started this project to learn more about Jekyll and some of its themes and plugins. I'm thinking about trying to make my own theme, but that will probably come a bit later.

<!-- more -->

I'd like to learn how to turn a Jekyll blog into something more powerful, something that includes things like:

- search
- archives
- categories and tags
- pagination
- seo

There are plugins that will add each of those features, but they're not that easy to set up. That's what I'm going to do here: start with the default Minima theme and add one feature at a time, until I've got something that's as powerful as WordPress.
