This is a post about site navigation in Jekyll (version 3.8.5) using Jekyll's default theme Minima (version 2.5.0). If you have a locally hosted Jekyll blog, have written a few posts, created an additional page or two, but haven't yet delved into Liquid markup, then this post is for you.

## The Basics

Minima makes adding a navigation menu to your Jekyll site pretty easy. Here's how to do it. In your project's _config.yml file, add the lines:
<br>
<br>
```yml
header_pages:
  - about.md
```
<br>
<br>
Make sure you still have an about.md file in your root directory. If your site is running in a local environment, stop your server and restart it. If you haven't changed your site's styles too drastically, then when you look at your homepage, you'll see an "About" menu item at the top right. 
<br>
<br>

![minima default menu](/assets/images/welcome-shot.png){:class="img-responsive"}
<br>
<br>

To add additional menu items, just add the file names of the pages you'd like to include in your menu, in the order in which you'd like them to appear, e.g.,
<br>
<br>

```yml
header_pages:
  - about.md
  - blog.md
  - portfolio.md
```
<br>
<br>

By default additional pages need to be added to your project's root directory. However, the Jekyll docs recommend placing your pages in a _pages directory. In order to do that you'll need to add one additional line to your _config.yml file:
<br>
<br>
```yml
include:
  - _pages
```
<br>
<br>
This setting tells Jekyll to include the *_pages* directory during conversion. Ordinarily, files or directories with a leading underscore or dot would be ignored during conversion.

Now you just need to alter the paths to your pages in *header_pages*. For example:
<br>
<br>
```yml
header_pages:
  - _pages/about.md
  - _pages/blog.md
  - _pages/portfolio.md
```
<br>
<br>
## How does it work?

Let's take a look at the logic that's powering Minima's menu. Use 'bundle show minima' to locate and then navigate to the Minima theme's directory. I'm using rvm, so on my machine that path looks like this:

```yml
/usr/share/rvm/gems/ruby-2.5.1/gems/minima-2.5.0
```
In the *_includes* folder, find and open the *header.html* file. Take a look at lines 4 and 5:
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
```rb
{%- assign default_paths = site.pages | map: "path" -%}
{%- assign page_paths = site.header_pages | default: default_paths -%}
```
{% endraw %}
<br>
<br>
What we're seeing here is Liquid markup. Liquid is a template language written in Ruby. Liquid isn't a full-blown programming language, but it does allow you to do things like control flow with conditional statements, and iterate over arrays. 

In short, lines 4 and 5 declare a new variable called *page_paths* that is assigned to an array of file paths leading to the pages we'd like to appear in our menu, e.g. ["_pages/about.md", "_pages/blog.md"]. Now, let's walk through it.

### Line 4
- Line 4 declares a new variable called *default_paths* and assigns it to an expression that evaluates to an array of page file paths. 
- *site.pages* is a built-in Jekyll object that contains an array of page objects. Each page object contains metadata about a page on your site. 
- The pipe operator tells Liquid to take the value of the expression to the left of the pipe and run the filter to the right of the pipe on that value.  In this case, we're running the *map* filter on *site.pages*. 
- The *map* filter creates an array of values by extracting the values of a named property from another object. In this case, *map* is using the "path" property, which, in order to write this line, you'd have to know in advance is a property of each *site.pages* object, to extract the path values associated with that key.

### Line 5
- Line 5 declares a new variable called *page_paths* and assigns to it an expression that evaluates to another array of page file paths. 
- *site.header_pages* is the custom variable that we created in _config.yml and within which we defined an array of pages paths and file names, e.g. "_pages/about.md".
- In this case, we're running the *default* filter  on *site.header_pages*. The *default* filter allows you to specify a fallback in case a value doesnâ€™t exist. *default* will show its value if the left side of the pipe is nil, false, or empty. In this case, *page_paths* will default to *default_paths* in the event that *site.header_pages* is empty.

So, we have a *page_paths* variable with some page paths in it, but what are we going to do with it? Well, we used to use the truthiness of page_paths to determine whether there were any pages to navigate to, in which case, Jekyll would display our navigation menu to the user. The code looked like this:

{% raw %}
```rb
{%- if page_paths -%}
...navigation markup
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}

This changed a bit at the end of October, 2018, when a new line was added just after lines 4 and 5:

{% raw %}
```rb
{%- assign titles_size = site.pages | map: 'title' | join: '' | size -%}
```
{% endraw %}

Let's walk through it.

- Line 6 declares a new variable called *titles_size* and assigns to it an expression that evaluates to the number of characters in all of the page titles joined together. 
- As we discussed earlier, *site.pages* is a built-in Jekyll object that contains an array of page objects. Each page object contains metadata about a page on your site.
- In this case, we're running the *map* filter on *site.pages*
- The *map* filter creates an array of values by extracting the values of a named property from another object. In this case, *map* is using the "title" key, which, in order to write this line, we would need to know in advance is a property of each *site.pages* object, to extract the values associated with that key. 
- Next, the array created by *map* is passed to *join.* *join* combines the items in an array into a single string using its argument as a separator. In this case, the argument is an empty string, which will have the effect of joining our page titles end-to-end.
- Next, the string created by *join* is passed to *size.* *size* returns the number of characters in a string (or the number of items in an array).

The line testing for the truthiness of *page_paths* up above, was then swapped out for a test for whether *titles_size* is greater then zero:
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
```rb
{%- if titles_size > 0 -%}
...navigation markup
{% endif %}
```
{% endraw %}
<br>
<br>
Why the change? Well, imagine you need a single page site. Not even an about.md, just the index.md. In that case, you wouldn't want to see any sort of menu. Unfortunately, before the swap, on a phone or small screen, users *would* see a hamburger menu. Even worse, if you were to give index.md a title in the front matter, say, "Home," then when opened the hamburger would contain a "Home" item, even on the homepage. 

The reason for this behavior is that *page_paths* will never by falsy, because it will always contain at least our default paths: index.md, 404.html, assets/main.scss, and feed.xml. 
<br>
<br>
![hamburger open state](/assets/images/jekyll-hamburger-open.png){:class="img-responsive"}
<br>
<br>
Switching from *page_paths* to *titles_size* solved this problem. If you're working on a single page site, then as long as you do not give index.md a title in the front matter, *titles_size* will be zero. It doesn't even matter whether you have a *header_pages* setting containing about.md in _config.yml, because you're no longer checking *page_paths* when deciding whether to show the menu. 

All of that was preliminary. Assuming that we do have some pages with titles, the real action takes place on lines 21 through 26.
<br>
<br>
{% raw %}
```rb
{%- for path in page_paths -%}
  {%- assign my_page = site.pages | where: "path", path | first -%}
  {%- if my_page.title -%}
    <a class="page-link" href="{{ my_page.url | relative_url }}">
      {{ my_page.title | escape }}
    </a>
  {%- endif -%}
{%- endfor -%}
```
{% endraw %}
<br>
<br>
In short, these lines loop over each *path* in the *page_paths* array, grab the path, and, if the page has a title, display a link to the page.

Let's walk through it.

### Line 21
- Line 21 sets up a loop that will iterate over each *path* value in the *page_paths* array.

### Line 22
- Line 22 declares a new variable called *my_page* and assigns it to an expression that evaluates to a file path.
- *site.pages* is a built-in Jekyll object that contains an array of page objects. Each page object contains metadata about a page on your site.
- The *where* filter creates an array of values by extracting every object in the array of objects to the left of the pipe that has a property with a particular value. In this case, *where* will extract every page object from *site.pages* that has a *path* property the value of which is the *path* over which we're currently iterating. That's a bit of mouthful. Put another way, if the page object we're iterating over is one whose "path" property is the path we're currently iterating over, then *where* will grab it and put it in a new array.  
- The *first* filter returns the first item in an array. In this case, *first* is returning the first item in the array created by *where*. That array may only have one item, but it's still an array.

### Line 23
- Line 23 tests the truthiness of *my_page.title*. If *my_page.title* is neither nil nor false, then it's truthy, in which case the block of code it contains will execute. Put another way, if the current page has a title, then we can proceed to the next line.

### Line 24
- Line 24 is an HTML anchor tag that will show a link to a page
- The tag's "href" property is set to an expression that evaluates to the path to the current page. The value will depend on your site's structure. An example might be, "
- *my_page.url* refers the current page's "url" property
- The *relative* filter prepends a directory to a file path.
